**A network** is a group of connected devices that are able to communicate with each other.
In the LAN, devices are connected to the **switch** which is connected also to the **routers**, connected also to the **ISP/Other Networks**. Every device in our network has a IP address.

## What is DNS

**Dns** stands for domain name system. For devices on the network to be reachable, they must be addressable. DNS maps domain names to their respective IP addresses. So DNS is a protocol that let us use domain name instead of ip addresses. The advantage of DNS is that it allows us to use multiple IP Addresses for the same domaine name. To know the domain name of a host, just use **dig url.com**.  

**/etc/resolve.conf** is used to determine which host to use for DNS queries

**/etc/hosts** is used for statically mapping IP addresses to hostnames 
**host DNS** is used to trandform a domain name in an IP addresses
