## What is Cloud?
A cloud is a compilation of data centers that providing compute services, storage, networking and applications services over the internet. Software and services that run and are available on the internet

## How does it works?
The cloud is hosted in various locations around the world. In the case of AWS, Data are stored in **Avaibility zone** and each each availability zone is inside a **region**. An Avaibility zone is a collection of data centers in a region. Each region is independant of other regions and is a good thing because incase of failure in one place, we can move data to another place (Fault tolerant/redondant). The local network instance for the compute running in the cloud is called **Subnet**.saaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaddddd
