  ## PYTHON SYNTAX AND DATA TYPES - GETTING FAMILIAR WITH PYTHON SYNTAX, DATA TYPES AND VARIABLES

# Install Python on Windows machine
- Go to google and search for **install python on windows**. Download the executable file and install it successfully
- To verify the installation, go to VSC, open a new terminal and tape the command **python --version**

# Execute python Program

  We will write our first program: Hello World.
  - Create a folder and a new pythonfile. Every python file finish with **.py**;
  - write my python program: print("Hello, World !!"). 
  - Save and Run the program by clicking on Run
  - Execute the program by using **python filename.py**
  - Our first program is running

# Python Syntax
- To separate 2 blocks in python, just have a white space below a statement
- use **#** below a phrase, to comment something: it will not appear in the script

  ## Numeric Data Type
  We have
  **Integer data type** like x= 123
  **Float data type** like y = 1.234
  **string data type** like a = "Adrienne"
  We can use "" or ''. But if a string content already **'**, we need to put **""**
  - if your string is on more than one line, we need to put **'''** at the beginning and the end of this string
    
  **Boolean Data type** like variable a = true   or  variable b = false

  **List Data type** refers to collection of items which can be of different types like   a = [1,2,3, 'adrienne', true]. List is mutable. After creating a list, we can change the value. Ex: if we write a[0]=6   that's means our new list will be  a= [6,2,3, 'adrienne', true}
  **tuple Data Type**: is similar to list but the difference is that tuple is **immutable**. Tuple syntax is b = **(** 1,2,3, 'adrienne', true **)**
