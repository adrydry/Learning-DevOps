Python is a high level (Easily readable by human), versatile (it can be used for devops, data analyst and so on) and dynamically typed (we dont need to define the data type of the variable) programming language. 


# Key features of Python
 
- Easy to learn and read: 
- Multiple purposes: we can do web development, build application including frontend, backend, devops, Automation script,
- Interpreted language: no need to compile our source code separely. when the source is written, we can just run it and it will be interpreted as runtime
- Rich standard library: Python has his own librairies and packages that can be used to execute a specific task;
- Platform independance: Python is not just supported on linux or windows OS but by any type of OS;
- Large community & ecosystem: Most used programming language in the world. So we have many developpers that create new librairies and packages which can be used to perform specific tasks and that reduce our manual efforts

  # Python for DevOps

  Python is used by Devops engineers in their daily activities tasks for :
# Scripting and automation some activities like:
  
   **Take backup of folder**: Sometimes, DevOps engineers have certains folders that contains complete data and to make sure they're making complete backup of data, incase anything happens, they write shellscript which will run at a specific intervalle of time and they backup folders or files.

# Configuration Management: 
DevOps engineers use Ansible to configure VM and Ansible is based on Python

# CICD
They can perform Python based applications by writing a python script to build and deploy. we will just need to install Python in the cicd tool to perform the python script

# Monotoring and logging
It can be use to monitor our application instead of grafana for exple even if we will not have the dashboard, but the job will be done by using the different packages and librairies available
