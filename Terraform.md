## Cloud Providers
We will configure the AWS provider that will give Terraform access to the AWS API to perform operations on AWS infrastructure. For that, Go to terraform registry, check AWS, select EC2 instances. 

- In our cloud9 terminal, create a directory for our project. Inside the directory, create a **.tf** file. Inside the file, copy and paste API for the AWS provider Ec2 instances. Make all the necessary modifications
