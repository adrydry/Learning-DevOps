**Shellscripting** has the ability to read and execute commands from a file and that's why it's very used for automating tasks. Bash is the commun shell used in Linux. Exple: l have a task to create 100 files. Instead of doing manually *touch filename - 100 times*, l can wite a script like **For 1 in (1..100); do touch newfile_$1;done
**
